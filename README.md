# LockPrepMacro
Single button macro for TBC Warlock 2v2 arena preparation.

To use it, just extract the files into **/Interface/AddOns/LockPrepMacro** folder (**not** LockPrepMacro-main which is the zip name when you download it here), make an ingame macro with:
```
/click LockPrepMacro
```
and spam it when you enter arena. That's it. You'll have to summon Felhunter + sacrifice Voidwalker manually though. This will take care of everything (?) else. :)

It will:
```
Summon Imp
```
```
Buff Fire Shield, Unending Breath, Detect Invisibility on you and your partner, and Fel Armor on you
```
```
Summon Voidwalker
```
```
Create and Equip Master Spellstone
```
```
Create Healthstone, trade it to your partner and create another
```

Should be safe to spam the macro all the way until you're done!
