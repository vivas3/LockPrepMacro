# LockPrepMacro
Single button macro for TBC Warlock arena preparation. Works for 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5 now!

To use it, just extract the files into **/Interface/AddOns/LockPrepMacro** folder (**not** LockPrepMacro-main which is the zip name when you download it here), make an ingame macro with:
```
/click LockPrepMacro
```
and spam it when you enter arena. That's it. You'll have to summon Felhunter, sacrifice Voidwalker and cast Soul Link manually though. This will take care of pretty much everything else. :)

It will:
```
Summon Imp
```
```
Buff Fire Shield, Unending Breath, Detect Invisibility on you and your partner(s), and Fel Armor on you
```
```
Summon Voidwalker
```
```
Create and Equip Master Spellstone
```
and

**2v2:**
```
Create Healthstone, trade it to your partner and create another
```
**3v3 & 5v5:**
```
Cast Soulwell
```
Should be safe to spam the macro all the way until you're done!
